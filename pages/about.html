<body> I have a background in applied behavior analysis. For three years, I have worked as a registered behavior technician. This means I conduct behavioral therapy sessions with chidren who have behavioral issues, mainly this means children with ASD, ADHD/ADD, down syndrome, etc. However, I have come to learn that it's not only children whth diasnosises who need the help of ABA.
Additionally, getting aproved for ABA services can be a long process including a lot of jumping through hoops. This includes logn wait lists at ABA angencies, insurance requirements and approvals, assessments and observations, parent interviews, and more. 
It should'nt be that hard to get behavioral help for your children. 
  <p>With the resources I will provide for you, behavior support and interventions will be at you ringer tips. Easy and fast to access with any additional support needed to impliment these evidence based practices effectively and correctly. I will provide you with everything you need to know to implement these intervantions but evidence based practices dont work without consistency. It will take consistant implimentation over multiple months </p></body>

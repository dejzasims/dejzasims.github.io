    <h1>Welcome to my blog and digital marketplace</h1>
  <p>The internet is used by over 5.6 billion people in 2025. With access to the internet, like a main street in a big, developed city, you can find any and everything you're looking for from your phone or computer. From researching a topic for school, to buying the perfect gift, to simply figuring out whats for dinner. It is essentially the exchange of information, and through that information, we able to also exchange goods and products.
A child can exibit problem behaviors for a variety of reasons. Whether they have a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder or ADHD/ADD, or maybe they just struggle with things we cant comprehend. Regardless the reason, dealing with these behavioral issues on a day to basis as a parent can be draining and sometimes make you feel like you're failing. Here you will find resources such as recommended purchases, digital products, and planners and templates to make your days run smoother. Everything I reccomend is backed up by evidenced based practices, applied behavior analysis, and sometimes just plain old experience.</p>
